b. Using the cat command view one.txt and two.txt. Explain the content

2. Which [Month, Year] had the most YouTube channels created
March 2006
As per the Dataset, Top 3 [Month, Year] with the most number of YouTube channels created were :
2006,Mar, 15 channels
2014,Jul, 13 channels
2014,Aug, 12 channels 
The command(s) used to find it was this: _______________
cut -d',' -f20,21 Global\ YouTube\ Statistics.csv > dates.txt
sort -t',' -k20,20n -k21,21M dates.txt > sortedDates.txt
uniq -c sortedDates.txt | sort -k1,1n | tail -3 > topDates.txt
Explain the command along with the parameters used and the reason for using them.
The cut command grabs the date colums for us. -f 20,21 tells it to go to those specifically, those lines have the year and months.
Sort grabs them in order.
Uniq counts the amounts of dates, sorted them, and tail will give us the highest amounts first

3. Write the command you would use to find all the processes owned by you. Paste the output of the same. 
ps -u $USER

    PID TTY          TIME CMD
3984744 ?        00:00:01 systemd
3984746 ?        00:00:00 (sd-pam)
3984753 ?        00:00:00 sshd
3984757 pts/49   00:00:00 bash
4009117 pts/49   00:00:00 tmux: client
4009121 ?        00:00:00 tmux: server
4009122 pts/2    00:00:00 bash
4009642 pts/73   00:00:00 bash
4010870 pts/73   00:00:00 ps

4. Open two terminals and login to the IBM VM
   PID TTY          TIME CMD
3984744 ?        00:00:01 systemd
3984746 ?        00:00:00 (sd-pam)
3984753 ?        00:00:00 sshd
3984757 pts/49   00:00:00 bash
4009117 pts/49   00:00:00 tmux: client
4009121 ?        00:00:00 tmux: server
4009122 pts/2    00:00:00 bash
4009642 pts/73   00:00:00 bash
4009892 pts/2    00:00:00 vim
4010204 pts/73   00:00:00 ps
Having the vim process running on the second terminal shows an extra process when viewing processes on the second terminal, showcasing how both terminals are controlled by the same user.

After closing vim on terminal one, the output matches the same as the output in terminal 3. This is because vim is no longer running on terminal one.

5. What is the init process in Linux ? Find the process id for the init process. Show the command you used to do this. ( Note: The init process is also called systemd in the flavor we use on IBM V

USER         PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME
│COMMAND│root           1  0.3  0.0 178624 18368 ?        Ss   Oct05  45:18
│/usr/lib/systemd/systemd --switched-root --system --deserialize 17
│[anasf23@sjsu Assignment2]$

Command used: ps aux | sort -k2,2n | head -2
6. Explain 'ps aux' in not more than 4 sentences.

The command shows all running processes of the user in a neat, readable format categorized in labeled columns.
