I dont know why my history command is only including 2 commands from my current session? Maybe it is because of tmux. I will have to ask the professor next week. So I will just retype the commands I used
(below, you can see those commands were from last assignment, until ps aux)  
507  git add Subscribers
  508  git status
  509  git commit
  510  git push
  511  git pull
  512  git push
  513  vi file.txt
  514  ps aux | sort -k2,2n | head -2
  515  history > cmds.log
-----------------------
mkdir Assignment2
cd Assignment2
touch Assignment2.txt
wget (youtube.csv link)
cut -d',' -f20,21 Global\ YouTube\ Statistics.csv > dates.txt
sort -t',' -k20,20n -k21,21M dates.txt > sortedDates.txt
uniq -c sortedDates.txt | sort -k1,1n | tail -3 > topDates.txt
vi all of those .txts to verify results
ps -u $USER
tmux (CTRL+B % to create second terminal window)
vi file.txt
ps aux | sort -k2,2n | head -2
history > cmds.log
(that should be about all of them lol)
